			This is the URL which the ERP system will use for confirming that the XML file has been
			correctly downloaded. In order to do that, the ERP system will have to append to the
			URL the MD5 checksum of the downloaded file (Note that this URL alreay contains an empty 
			parameter called "md5").
			When the URL is accessed this way, Keyos will reply with the strings "ok" or "incorrect"
			if the checksum is correct or not.
			If the checksum is incorrect, the XML file can be re-downloaded using the URL specified
			in the "retransfer_url" element.

		<xs:element name="confirmation_import_url" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="1"  maxOccurs="1">
			<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>
			This is the URL which the ERP system will use for confirming that the correct values have
			been imported from the XML file. In order to do that, the ERP system will have to add to the
			URL the following parameters: "cnt_timesheets" - the number of timesheets processed and
			"work_time_sum" - the sum of all the work_time fields from all timesheets. For example:
			?cl=erp&amp;op=timesheets_confirm_import&amp;id=41&amp;cnt_timesheets=2&amp;work_time_sum=10.30
			When the URL is accessed this way, Keyos will reply with the strings "ok" or "incorrect"
			if the values are correct or not. If they are correct, then all the intervention reports
			from the import batch will be marked as being centralized in the ERP system.
